# crypto-tracker V0.1
WIP!
To do:
* Make it prettier!!!
* Being able to change currencies
* Clean up the code base. Lot of old test files, and unused junk..


Features:
* Add different cryptos to account. Custom amounts and purchasing price.
* Edit crypto entry, ie. change original purchase price, or change amount bought.
* See all crypto entries at once, in portfolio details
* See specifc cryptocurrency entries. Eg. see all Bitcoin entries or all ethereum entries
* See a summarized version on main page, with one entry per crypto (Able to see average purchasing price and holdings in usd)

Known bugs:
* If more than one entry of the same crypto has been made, you can only change the first entry (Solved)
